# My Smart Marketplace DApp

This project uses the Celo Blockchain toolkit and Web3 to allow people buy or sell products.

It's still a very basic project and is a project example from [Dacade](https://dacade.org/communities/celo/courses/celo-development-101).

## Warning!!!

This is a **modified** clone from the [Dacade's](https://github.com/dacadeorg/celo-marketplace-dapp) Marketplace DApp example.

That's to say, in case you find any issue in running the Dacade's Marketplace DApp from their course, you can always use this project to get back on track.

Enjoy!
